<div class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions</div>
<div class="container">
   <p><b>What attractions require socks?</b></p>
   <p>Socks are required to play in the Jungle Playland with Ballocity. If you are wearing flip-flops, crocs, or other types of shoes that will fall off, then socks are required to go on the bungee trampoline and climbing walls as well. Socks are available to purchase at the main entry if needed.</p>

   <p><b>What happens if it rains?</b></p>
   <p>All rides will remain open in a light rain. The outside rides will close temporarily if there is lightning in the area or in heavy rain or very high winds and they will re-open when it settles down. Refunds and rain checks are not provided for bad weather. There are many attractions that can be enjoyed regardless of weather conditions.</p>

   <p><b>Do I have to pay even if I am not going to play?</b></p>
   <p>Children ages 3 to 15 must have a wristband to enter the park. Adults are free if they just want to watch and play in the Jungleland with the children as long as they are accompanying a paid guest. Children 2 and under are free to play in the Jungleland, Toddler Zone, and Splash Zone (seasonal) as long as they are accompanied by a paid guest, but they would need a wristband to participate in other attractions.</p>

   <p><b>Do I have to pay to ride with my child?</b></p>
   <p>Yes, you would need to either purchase a ride ticket or a wristband to ride with your child. There is a go-kart driver band for $5.99 that allows an adult to drive children unlimited on the go-karts if you do not plan to do anything else.</p>

   <p><b>If my child is tall enough to drive the go-karts, can he/she drive a smaller child?</b></p>
   <p>Children under 56 inches (and at least 36 inches) can only ride with an adult or someone with a driver's license or permit.</p>

   <p><b>Can children be dropped off?</b></p>
   <p>Children under the age of 12 may not be left unattended.</p>

   <p><b>What attractions can I participate in if I am pregnant?</b></p>
   <p>If you are pregnant, you can play games and play in the Jungleland with the children, but you will not be able to participate in any rides.</p>

   <p><b>Can we leave the park and come back?</b></p>
   <p>Yes, as long as you keep your wristband on, you can leave and return the same day.</p>

   <p><b>Is food sold at the park?</b></p>
   <p>Yes, food and drinks are available for purchase at Daniellie's Kitchen, located in the main building.</p>

   <p><b>Can I bring in my own food and drink?</b></p>
   <p>You are more than welcome to bring your own food or drinks to the outside park. No glass and no alcohol are allowed at the park. Ice chests and bags may be searched. You can bring a cake or cupcakes into the building, but no other outside food or drinks are allowed inside.</p>

   <p><b>Can I still bring a cake if I do not book a party?</b></p>
   <p>Yes, you can bring a cake inside the main building or to the outside park. However, other outside food and drinks may only be brought to the outside eating area.</p>

   <p><b>How much does parking cost?</b></p>
   <p>Parking is free!</p>

   <p><b>Are lockers available?</b></p>
   <p>Yes, lockers may be rented at the main entry for $10, and $4 is refunded when you return the key. Lockers are located in the main building as well as at the water park.</p>

   <p><b>What if I lost something at the park?</b></p>
   <p>If you lost something, please check at the main entry as most items do get turned in. We are not responsible for any lost or stolen items. Please call 702 402 434 during our business hours to check on a lost item if you have already left the park.</p>

   <p><b>Is alcohol allowed at the park?</b></p>
   <p>No, alcohol cannot be brought into the park and is not allowed to be consumed anywhere on the premises.</p>

   <p><b>Is smoking allowed at the park?</b></p>
   <p>There is one designated smoking section in the park, located near the main building in the outside section of the park. There is also one ashtray near the entrance to the park in the parking lot. These are the only two locations on the property that smoking is allowed.</p>

   <p><b>Are pets allowed at the park?</b></p>
   <p>Pets are not allowed at the park, with the exception of service animals.</p>

   <p><b>Are cameras allowed?</b></p>
   <p>Yes, please bring your camera to take pictures of your family or group! However, we will not allow you to take pictures or aim your camera at other people at the park.</p>

   <p><b>What forms of payment are accepted?</b></p>
   <p>We accept cash or American Express, Master Card, Visa, and Discover cards. We do not accept personal checks.</p>

   <p><b>Can I buy tickets online?</b></p>
   <p>Yes! Tickets can now be purchased online, with an additional discount offered if the tickets are purchased at least a day in advance.</p>

   <p><b>Do you offer military, law-enforcement, or fire discounts?</b></p>
   <p>Yes, we offer 10% off the Unlimited Wristband for you, your spouse and your children with military, fire, law enforcement ID or badge. Tickets can also be purchased at Randolph AFB, Lackland AFB, and Fort Sam at a discounted price.</p>

   <p><b>Are bathing suits required to go on water rides?</b></p>
   <p>Bathing suits are definitely recommended for water rides, but are not required. If you wear normal clothes, be prepared to get soaked!</p>
